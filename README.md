Quantitative benefit–cost analysis of two infrastructure projects (dams) using Excel-based modeling and impact evaluation metrics.

Benefit–Cost Analysis of Infrastructure Projects

This project presents a comparative benefit–cost analysis of two proposed dam infrastructure projects. Using structured quantitative evaluation, it assesses the potential socio-economic and environmental returns from each project and calculates their feasibility using the Benefit–Cost Ratio (BCR).

##  Project Objectives
- Evaluate and compare the viability of Dam #1 and Dam #2 using benefit–cost analysis.
- Identify the most impactful benefits including navigation, hydropower, biodiversity, recreation, flood control, and commercial development.
- Calculate BCR to determine whether total benefits outweigh the associated capital and operational costs.

##  Methodology
- **Benefits Assessed**:
  - Improved Navigation  
  - Hydroelectric Power Generation  
  - Fish & Wildlife Ecosystem Support  
  - Recreation Opportunities  
  - Flood Control Infrastructure  
  - Commercial Development Impact

- **Costs Considered**:
  - Annualized Capital Investment  
  - Operational & Maintenance Costs  
  - Other Project Overheads

- **BCR Calculation**:
  - A BCR > 1.0 indicates the project is economically viable.

##  Key Insights
- **Dam #1**: Stronger in flood control and commercial potential but comes with higher upfront costs.
- **Dam #2**: Offers balanced benefits across multiple domains with a favorable BCR, indicating better economic feasibility.
- Both projects provide unique contributions; strategic alignment with development goals determines optimal selection.

##  Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Financial modeling, BCR calculation, and visualization
- **Microsoft Word**: Report generation and interpretation of findings

##  Files Included
- `Cost_Analysis.xlsx` – Contains benefit and cost calculations for both dams
- `Cost_Analysis_Report.docx` – Full narrative report including context, rationale, and results
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation

##  Summary
This analysis provides a robust framework for evaluating large-scale infrastructure projects using BCR. It empowers decision-makers to prioritize investments that maximize societal and economic value while managing costs.
